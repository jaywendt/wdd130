      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hello!  I am a clothing designer specialized in making custom clothing for all body types.  Do you remember the last time you’ve been out shopping, but couldn’t find a single piece in your size?  Everyone wants good clothes, but much of the clothing out there never fits.  I’m here to fix this issue.  I’m starting up a website where I can provide clothing that is stylish, comfortable, and, most importantly, built to YOUR body type for cheap.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is all people who want to find good clothing in their own sizes.  We've all been in that spot where we find a super nice piece of clothing but its never in our size, so this website is meant to help out everyone, not just a specific niche of people.  We will cater to all ages, sizes, sexes, and handle any specific requests to the best of our ability, eliminating the need to run to multiple stores for one shirt.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
